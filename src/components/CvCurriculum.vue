        Open to new experiences, I have recently discovered a new world, web developing and I find it very interesting, so I decided to start to study for it and I am ready now to take this new challenge. I am very passionate about this new carrier and I love to follow the latest trend for better looking projects.
My long-standing experience in the restaurant industry and store manager, I have acquired knowledge of marketing, operational management and financial supervision. The experience combined with management skills, have allowed me to achieve brilliant results, with regard to customer satisfaction.
 Recognized and attested skills, continuous updating, effective management, optimization of work times and general costs.In addition, I fully agree with the company's philosophy, that is to take into account the client's requests.
"Thirst and hunger" of professional growth, which characterizes me ... Ambitious, strong will, decisive, sociable, perspicacious, willing and ready to face new "challenges".
